# CHANGELOG

## Unreleased

### Added

- Phase 0 SwiftUI app shell targeting iOS 17.0 with Swift 6 strict concurrency.
- Shared build/test scheme, unit-test target, and UI-test target.
- Feature flags, string catalog, privacy manifest, and persistent agent memory.
- Asset catalog scaffold with an accent color and App Icon slot.
- GitHub Actions validation and reusable local validation scripts.
- Proprietary public-repository license notice.
- English and Simplified Chinese rendered-localization smoke coverage.
- Versioned SwiftData schema with expense, budget, wishlist, insight, merchant,
  reflection, cooling-off, category-budget, and reminder-event models.
- Exact minor-unit `Money`, typed domain enums, and Sendable data projections.
- Actor-isolated local persistence, validated settings/configuration codecs, and
  deterministic new-user, three-month, end-of-cycle, and overspent sample data.
- State-machine enforcement for wishlist transitions and persistence tests for
  restart durability, cascade deletion, and weak purchase links.
- Pure budget snapshot and purchase-impact calculations with checked minor-unit
  arithmetic, category risk, and explicit unconfigured behavior.
- Calendar-injected budget cycles with month-end/DST handling, contiguous lazy future-
  plan generation, and immutable historical boundaries.
- Locale-aware currency formatting for supported fractional and zero-exponent currencies.

### Changed

- Limited V1 device support to iPhone.
- Moved the bundle identifier prefix into an overridable xcconfig.
- Replaced constant-only smoke assertions with bundle localization checks.
- Clarified that capability FeatureFlags do not enable default-off user features.
- Aligned hosted CI with Xcode 26.6+, made simulator selection dynamic, and pinned
  the checkout action to its reviewed commit.
- Replaced duplicate build/test work with build-for-testing/test-without-building.
- Added one hosted-only retry for a confirmed cold-simulator UI launch timeout.
- Replaced persisted fractional thresholds with integer basis points so financial
  state remains free of binary floating-point values.
- Replaced the purchasing-power-sensitive one-million-major-unit cap with a
  currency-neutral minor-unit safety limit.
- Defined future cycle-start changes as a contiguous transition cycle followed by the
  new cadence, without rewriting an existing plan.

### Fixed

- Expanded the floating-point money guard to the complete app source tree while
  retaining the single documented App Intents transport exception.
- Made iOS deployment and bundle identifier validation target-specific and strict.
- Made local validation compatible with macOS Bash 3.2 when hosted-only test retry
  arguments are disabled.
- Prevented corrupt persisted currency and enum values from crashing or silently
  changing business meaning during projection.
- Reused one `DataActor` per controller, made sample replacement rollback-safe, and
  maintained merchant aggregates from expense creates and deletes.
- Replaced the local-store startup crash with a retryable, localized recovery screen.

### Privacy

- Declared no tracking, no tracking domains, and no collected data types.
- Declared the required-reason UserDefaults API category for app settings.
